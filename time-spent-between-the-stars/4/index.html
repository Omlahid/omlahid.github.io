<h1>Of Time Spent Between The Stars</h1>
<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p>It had been so little time since his last jump that Sandeep kept to the same routine. He did, however, have the one new book to read, which he was excited for.</p>
<p>Sandeep found the first twenty pages captivating, setting up a great intrigue. But the rest of the book fell short of his expectations, falling into a long-winded slog that seemed to lead nowhere. The ending even failed to resolve most of the questions the book had originally asked. Sandeep still enjoyed having something to read, but felt like he just couldn’t get a break with new media.</p>
<p>Eagerly, he waited to arrive in the solar system, idly spending his days listening to Maddy’s music and eating his food for hours on end, one small bite at a time.</p>
<p>When he arrived on the edge of the system and went back to subluminal speeds, he was hit with a similar experience as when he’d first arrived in the Solar system: upgrades, upgrades, upgrades. He’d hoped Luiz had figured out a way to stop this more permanently, but apparently that was not something that could just stop—every company was trying to push him to upgrade everything on his ship.</p>
<p>However, Sandeep had looked at what Luiz had done, and he’d made sure to pay attention. He was able to get most of the updates off again, and at the very least, the rig became silent once again. That was when he heard a voice coming from his comm system.</p>
<p>“Rig B16VD, please report to gate…wait. Are you… wait is it you again? Over.” Sandeep didn’t recognize the voice at first, but the excitement gave it away.</p>
<p>“Hey Luiz,” Sandeep answered. “It’s Sandeep. Nice hearing from you again. I hope you had fun back in Mexico city. Over.”</p>
<p>“Sandeep! That’s it! I can't believe you got to me! Come on, we have a lot to catch up on. Can you park at gate A24-16 for maybe three more hours? I can come aboard after. Over.” Sandeep agreed, parked at the designated gate, and waited. The hours passed slower than any of the hours he'd spent in the last ten days, as the expectation of meeting Luiz again was making him particularly giddy.</p>
<p>Three hours passed, and Sandeep saw a cruiser dock through his sensors. He rushed to the airlock.</p>
<p>The person on the other side of the airlock was not exactly who he thought it would be. Sure, it was still Luiz—he recognized the moustache, the smile, and the excitement in his eyes. But his hair had greyed, and he was wearing a completely different style of clothes. Even the moustache, he now realized, had grey hair splattered through, as well as vibrant white hair adding to the salt and pepper effect.</p>
<p>Sandeep was taken aback by the sight, and judging from Luiz’s expression, it showed on his face. It's not that Sandeep was unfamiliar with time relativity, but it was the first time that he'd actually experienced it in a way that mattered.</p>
<p>The airlock finally finished pressurizing, and Sandeep took an extra second before opening the door.</p>
<p>“Wow Luiz, you've…aged?” said Sandeep tentatively. He knew his attempt at conversation was gauche, but his mind was still comprehending just how much time he'd wasted between the stars.</p>
<p>“And you haven't,” answered Luiz, enthusiastically, though Sandeep could tell he was trying to calm him down. “Did you spend some time on Siris? I see you're back from there. Was it fun?”</p>
<p>“I didn't go on the planet. It's still very early in the stages of terraforming, and I’ve seen my fair share of terraforming growing up,” Sandeep said, trying to get his voice to sound normal. He'd always been a shy person, so he was hoping the lack of words would come out as more natural.</p>
<p>Luiz was still looking around the ship, as he had done recently—or at least, recently from Sandeep’s perspective.</p>
<p>“It really does look exactly the same. How long has it been for you then? A year?”</p>
<p>“Less than that. It’s not even been a month yet.” Luiz was surprised by the answer. “Wow, so I’m fresh in your memory then, am I?” he answered. “You know, a lot has happened since we last spoke. It’s been almost 19 years at this point I think. Or, wait. No, it’s been a bit over 19 years in fact!” He laughed at that realization, not seeing the anxiety it roused in Sandeep.</p>
<p>“Gosh, I hadn’t even met Anya back then, and I was still technically living with my parents on Earth. Nowadays I live on the Sirius relay stations along with my wife and my two daughters. They’re 8 and 6 now you know. Crazy how time flies.” These words were not lost on Sandeep, but it seemed that Luiz was too concerned with revisiting his life to realize the pain he was stirring.</p>
<p>“You should come over. I checked with my team, and they don’t mind having you park the rig at the station so long as you drop off your cargo first. Here, let me enter my address in your system. I know you’re probably busy, but come over and have dinner, say, tomorrow night? Let me just sync some things.” He started walking towards the computer, and was taken aback as he approached it. “Wow, I’d forgotten just how archaic this all is. I’m so used to modern computers nowadays, and this is over a century old. No wonder it’s got the beeping lights for the updates. Hang on, let me put in the address in here.”</p>
<p>He started fiddling around on the computer, opening the maps, and stopped as he tried to enter something. “Wow. Truly, this is old. Your map can’t even take sub-station orbit velocity deltas in the parameters. I guess that didn’t exist back in the days, or not in a meaningful way. Okay, hang on, this is gonna be a bit rougher to input. Let me just.” Luiz started fiddling on the computer, before he turned back to Sandeep. “Do you mind if I update just the map? I don’t think I’ll be able to do anything without it.” Sandeep recalled the warning from Maddy: DO NOT UPDATE. Sandeep didn't know who to trust though. He thought, in a spur, that the person he’d spoken to twice and was actually present and trying to help was more likely to be helpful, than a vague warning written over fifty years ago by someone who he’d have to assume was a technophobe.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Sandeep added. “But if you could limit the update as much as possible?” He added tentatively. There was no guarantee Luiz would or even could honour that statement, but Sandeep knew he had to at least ask.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry old man,” he said, jokingly, very much aware of their true age gap. “I’ll be careful. I know you don’t want to mess up your system. I remember. I respect it.” Luiz started downloading a map update, and Sandeep could see the concentration in his eyes as he started opening other programs and aborting commands as he did so. Sweat started to form on his forehead, but a knowing smile was on his face as he did so. “I’d forgotten just how fun old computers can be. I might buy one from an old vintage shop when I get home, just to mess around.”</p>
<p>It took another minute before Luiz turned back towards Sandeep. “There, all done. Every other system should be good I think. I hope I didn’t break anything. But now you’ll have access to the actual map of the system, with every substation alongside it. But, most importantly, you’ll be able to visit me at home. I already put the address in, as well as the time we’d like you to be there. Can’t wait to see you again.” Luiz smiled.</p>
<p>Luiz left to get back home, leaving Sandeep once again alone in his rig, but this time with the promise of more to come.</p>
<p>The path to Earth’s high orbit was choked with traffic—worse than last time. It took Sandeep the whole day and even some of the night just to get to the warehouse. Thankfully, he noticed that the traffic back to the Sirius relay station was a lot sparser, so he would have an easier time getting to see Luiz and his family.</p>
<p>While at the warehouse, Sandeep shopped for more food, but couldn’t find what he’d been enjoying on board during the last few weeks. He had to pick up some different options, hoping they would be just as exciting. One thing he did notice, however, was just how much more expensive everything seemed to be. He did the math, and at this pace, if he kept buying provisions at Earth stations, he would never be able to afford to visit Earth. Worse, he’d barely be able to afford paying his rig back. He still owed quite a lot of money to the bank for it, but his account was still thankfully healthy, though he wouldn’t be able to stay long in this system.</p>
<p>When Sandeep arrived at Luiz’s home, he first noticed how large it felt. The stations in Earth’s high orbit were so cramped that Luiz’s home, which he’d guess probably had five bedrooms, felt like a mansion.</p>
<p>Sandeep got out of his cruiser—the same one he’d almost hurled in back when Maddy had taken him to see the rig for the first time—and Luiz came to hug him. “Sandeep, so glad to see you. Please, come see my wife and children. They’re just past this door.”</p>
<p>The door opened, and it truly felt like a lived-in home. It was messy, lively, noisy, but full of love. Sandeep was suddenly struck by homesickness. This home wasn’t even close in decor to what his house on Barnid had looked like, but the dynamics of the family, and the atmosphere, were unmistakable.</p>
<p>“You have a truly lovely home, Luiz.” Luiz smiled at Sandeep. “Thank you. It’s a great home, I agree. The children love it, though sometimes Anya finds that we’re far from what she calls real civilization. This is just a station, after all, not a full colony. We’re on the edge of the system, and the amenities are good and easy to access. But we get everything later than even orbiters do, and that bothers Anya a bit. But, you know, love is love. And it’s a lot cheaper to live here than it is to live on the planets.”</p>
<p>As they were talking, a young girl arrived, and tugged at Luiz’s shirt. “Ah, sorry Sandeep, let me introduce you to my children! This is my youngest, Isabela, and my oldest is just around the corner. Amina, dear, would you mind coming and saying hi?” A slightly older but still young girl waltzed from around the corner. While Isabela was more shy, Amina had the demeanour and extraversion of her dad.</p>
<p>Sandeep spent an excellent evening with Luiz and his family. Luiz had made some tamales, which he swore would taste better with fresh ingredients from Earth if he could just get his hands on them. But, to Sandeep, it tasted better than anything he’d ever had. There was nothing that would convince him that this wasn’t one of the best meals he’d ever eaten—the love was obvious and tasted amazing.</p>
<p>But, the one thing that Sandeep took away from the lovely evening, was the fact that he truly and deeply missed his family. As soon as he got back to his rig and slept off the food, he started looking for jobs back to Barnid.</p>
