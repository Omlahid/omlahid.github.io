<h1>Of Time Spent Between The Stars</h1>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>Time of day has a very different meaning out in space, but since he’d just woken up, Sandeep decided this was his morning. He adjusted his clock to fit that, and realized it perfectly aligned with the current time in Mexico city. He chuckled at that realization, before checking on the map where he could restock his pantry and catch a shuttle to visit Earth.</p>
<p>Sandeep was taken aback by just how many buildings and services were close by. If it weren’t for the fact that he was in space, he would have thought he was in the middle of a downtown metropolis. In fact, it seemed there were more buildings and services within a half hour’s drive than there were in the whole of New Bangalore back home.</p>
<p>Sandeep started looking at the map with more intention, and tried to decide what he wanted to do first. Earth, he thought. That’s the reason he came all this way.</p>
<p>He considered going to the shuttle station he dropped Luiz at yesterday, but realized it was a bit far, and there were other closer. He started driving, and without his cargo, felt a lot smaller and nimble.</p>
<p>He got to a shuttle station, and parked his rig in the designated area. Even without any cargo, his rig was much larger than any other vehicle in the area.</p>
<p>Sandeep took his cruiser out and got to the main building. That is when he realized his mistake. The shuttles to the surface were more expensive than he could afford, especially for his current levels of debt. There was no way he would be able to justify buying a ticket just to visit Earth, especially without taking accommodations into account. He also noticed just how expensive everything seemed to be on the surface, from food to lodging, even an entry fee for non-residents. Dejected, he decided to leave and go back to his rig. He would have to work a couple more jobs before he hoped to have enough money to visit the surface.</p>
<p>Searching for a new contract from Earth’s high orbit was almost overwhelming. The area was bustling with different companies and entities hoping to ship cargo to other systems. Sandeep chose a contract to the Sirius system, one of the most lucrative contracts he could find.</p>
<p>Before he left, Sandeep checked for entertainment media, hoping to have a less boring voyage to Sirius. Sandeep scanned the local net, and picked up a couple of contemporary music albums from Earth, from the top of the charts. He had no idea what he would be listening to, but he thought it would be a nice surprise. He also picked up a couple of videos he thought would be interesting. And with that, he was off to Sirius.</p>
<p>The road to Sirius was even longer than the one to Barnid. It would take a whole ten days to get there, and Sandeep was not entirely eager to travel it, especially just after his long week.</p>
<p>Sandeep picked up his cargo and went to the hyperplane station to Sirius without any issues, except for the traffic around Earth and Mars. His dispatcher hadn’t been quite as excited about his real time communication, and simply cleared the way for his jump.</p>
<p>One of the first things Sandeep did after his jump was to listen to the new albums he’d just bought, hoping to set the right mood. The music that played on the speakers was aggressively different from what he’d been listening to. This was fast, heavy music, with extremely suggestive and strong lyrics. He barely got through a couple of songs from the first album before he had to stop and sit in silence for a while. This was barely listenable—how could people on a planet as sophisticated as Earth, the gem of human civilization, be listening to something like this.</p>
<p>Disappointed, Sandeep started one of the videos instead. He couldn’t stop watching, but couldn’t help feeling like he wasn’t watching anything. There was no plot, no commentary, no obvious point to what he was watching. It felt like it was designed only to grab your attention, and nothing else. He watched the first video once, and stopped afterwards. He had no intentions of watching it again, and in fact, it turned him off from watching the other ones.</p>
<p>Sandeep quickly realized that none of the new content he’d gotten for the ride managed to keep him entertained in the slightest. He eventually resigned to put back the music that Maddy had left on the computer. At least, he thought, this was listenable, despite not being in a language he understood.</p>
<p>There was a silver lining to his Earth expedition: the food. The provisions from Earth tasted far better than the ones he had before, with a much richer and spicier flavour, and a great selection of sweeter dishes. He had to stop himself from eating too much, or he’d be running out of provisions much faster than anticipated.</p>
<p>The ten days at first went by extremely slowly, and suddenly, very quickly. The first two days felt excruciatingly boring, but Sandeep developed habits, and routine took over. Even though he wasn't doing much, he was able to get in a groove that kept him going.</p>
<p>Before he realized it, he was arriving in the Sirius system. It was a lot less busy than Earth, and felt closer to what he'd experienced around Barnard's.</p>
<p>The road to the main planet was quite empty, though he did see another rig pass him by on the way. He noticed the rig hailed him, but Sandeep took too long to figure out how to hail back, and only managed to do it once they’d already passed each other. He hoped the other jumper received it—Sandeep didn’t want to feel rude.</p>
<p>There was almost no point in staying in high orbit around Siris, the main planet of the Sirius system. It was obvious from above that the planet was still early in its terraforming process, and he had no doubts that his rig had brought more material for that purpose. This became especially clear when he saw there was only one warehouse of note—his cargo’s destination—and that the warehouse had the logo of a massive Terraforming corporation labelled on it. Thankfully, due to their size, they tended to be quick to pay, though they were thorough in their paperwork.</p>
<p>Sandeep managed to file all the forms and addendums, and found that the only place to recharge his rig was a building, near the edge from high to low orbit. He moved his rig there, and decided to take his cruiser into the building.</p>
<p>Stepping into the building, Sandeep realized just how much the artificial gravity on his ship was high compared to what he was used to. The building had an artificial gravity probably comparable to Siris, and if he had to guess, it was much closer to the one on Barnid, though possibly a little lighter.</p>
<p>The building was mostly a bar and restaurant, with a small shop on the side for provisions. A quick glance made him think that the food here would be inferior to what he could get on Earth, though the prices were much lower.</p>
<p>Sandeep, feeling the need for a bit of connection after his loneliness, headed for the bar section of the building first. There was no one there. He sat at the bar, and kept looking around to see if a bartender would appear to take his order. Instead, he saw a light illuminating his eyes, and suddenly, a menu was shown on his retina. He also heard through what he guessed was a localized speaker a welcome message.</p>
<p>He felt a little disgusted. Sandeep had only been hoping to speak to someone, with the drink being an excuse to socialize.</p>
<p>Still, not wanting to turn back right away, Sandeep ordered a pint of beer, which reminded him of Maddy. He’d spent so long listening to her music on the ship, he was starting to feel a connection to her. It was also the cheapest drink on the menu, and while he had just had a big pay from the terraforming company, he still owed quite a lot of money to the bank.</p>
<p>The beer was served by mechanical arms straight from the bar, and as he took his first sip, he realized it was lukewarm and had a horrid aftertaste. “This is probably one of those local beers” he thought, thinking again to what Maddy had said. But, unfortunately, Sandeep had no attachment to the Sirius system, and could find no comfort in the taste.</p>
<p>Sandeep tried to nurse his beer, always looking out the door to see if someone would walk in, but no one did. After waiting for about an hour without seeing a single soul, he decided to head back out of the bar.</p>
<p>The rest of the building was similarly empty. Sandeep felt like a ghost walking among the remains of a space station, though everything was in order. From time to time he’d come across a maintenance robot doing its duties. He even bought a couple of resources from the store. He tried to look through the entertainment section, but it seemed this store was so small they didn’t have much to offer. There were a couple of books though, and Sandeep bought one that looked interesting, supposedly about the murder of a crewmate aboard an interstellar voyaging ship.</p>
<p>Sandeep went back aboard his ship, defeated, unable to find anything he’d been hoping for.</p>
<p>He went to his console and started looking for jobs. The Sirius system was in such an early stage that there weren’t many jobs offered, but he was also one of the only jumpers in the area. All of the jobs had him go to the solar system, which he had expected. They were all, unfortunately, not nearly as lucrative as the job he’d just run. Still, he would have to leave the Sirius system one way or another, and doing it with a full cargo was more lucrative than doing it empty handed.</p>
<p>Sandeep took one of the jobs and started to head back towards the edge of the system. By this point, he was getting pretty used to this rodeo. He made his way to the hyperplane station, initiated the jump, and sat back.</p>
