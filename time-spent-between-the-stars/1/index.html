<h1>Of Time Spent Between The Stars</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>Sandeep couldn’t believe it was finally happening. An interstellar rig, all to himself, with a fully functional lightspeed engine to boot. Ever since he was a kid, he’d always wanted to travel to all the other planets. He wanted to see Earth in the Solar system, where his great grandparents had been born before they decided to move to Barnid, the terraformed planet around Barnard’s Star, where he lives. And now, having just turned 19, finally a full grown adult, he was ready to leave it.</p>
<p>His family wasn’t the richest, but they were able to get by comfortably. Sandeep was the first of two sons in a family of soil farmers, making the very earth that would cover the whole habitable regions of the planet. It takes generations to terraform a planet, and it’s through people like his family that there can be enough soil to make the plants that generate the planet’s atmosphere. In a generation or two, the planet would become as habitable as Mars or Proxima Prime.</p>
<p>But Sandeep didn’t want to stay on Barnid. He wanted to travel the stars, and see those planets for himself. And, lucky as he was, he’d found someone right here on the planet willing to sell their rig. Sandeep had managed to get credit from the bank, and he was leaving for New Bangalore, the city closest to his family’s farm, to meet the person who would sell him his dream.</p>
<p>He arrived at the coordinates—which was already peculiar as he'd expected an address. He was standing in front of a rather shady looking bar. He'd probably walked in front of it many times, but never thought to enter it. Today was the day he would.</p>
<p>It was early afternoon, so the bar was mostly empty. There was only one person in the whole room, with the bartender not even present. Noise from the kitchen indicated they were still opening up, and had left their lone early guest as the sole witness to Sandeep’s arrival.</p>
<p>Sandeep sat next to the other patron. She was wearing a short jacket with a bandana poking from under it—the kind of fashion he'd seen in pictures from the people who first came to Barnid in the time of his grandparents. She was also surprisingly young, maybe in her late twenties. From the way he'd spoken to her via messages, he would have guessed she was much older, closer to her sixties.</p>
<p>The person at the bar took notice of Sandeep as he sat.</p>
<p>“You’re that Sandeep kid I assume,” she blurted out, nursing a pint of beer.</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am,” Sandeep responded, hesitating on that last word. He still couldn't believe how young she looked. She noticed and smirked.</p>
<p>“No need to call me ma’am. I know I called you kid, but I call everyone here kid. It's not just you.” She took a sip of her beer, grimaced, and looked back to Sandeep. “You make this beer here, you know? Not imported, I can tell. Keeps the price down. I remember, only thirty years ago, doing this here would've been unthinkable, and yet here we are!” She laughed at her comment. “It's not good. Not really. But it's homemade. I think I prefer it that way.” She took another sip, but this time smiled.</p>
<p>Sandeep didn't know what to say, in awe of the presence she was exuding. “You can call me Maddy. I got the rig set right for you, parked up there, in lower orbit. Want me to show you?” Sandeep nodded, and Maddy snickered, before gulping down the rest of her beer in one go, with a slight grimace.</p>
<p>“Let's go,” she ordered, with Sandeep following quickly in tow. “The cruiser’s a bit old but it works well. Hop in.” She motioned to a low orbit cruiser, an extremely old model, typically used for quick inner planetary travel. But, it would sustain the low pressure and gravity up on the edge of space, and could even deal with high orbit travel if one was okay with slow speeds. Sandeep hadn't even had an opportunity to be in low orbit, except on a school trip once when he was much younger. He was pretty excited at this very small step. He hopped in the cruiser, as Maddy got in the driving seat.</p>
<p>“Strap in kid, this model doesn't do pressure negation. You're gonna feel all the G’s as we hit them.” A twinkle in her eye made him think she might be enjoying his mix of discomfort and excitement a bit too much.</p>
<p>Sandeep braced for impact, but there was no way he could ever have been ready. The cruiser blasted off into the atmosphere, and he stuck to his seat like roots in packed soil. For a second, Sandeep was sure he was going to hurl his lunch, but the mere speed of the cruiser forced it down. They finally arrived in low orbit, and the quick acceleration gave way to a contrasting sensation of weightlessness, as they reached zero gravity.</p>
<p>“You okay there kid? Almost looked like you’d throw your lunch up.” Maddy’s voice was weirdly comforting, despite her words sounding like she was teasing him. Sandeep nodded again, and gulped back the small amount of vomit that had made its way up his oesophagus.</p>
<p>“We’ll be there in a minute, don’t worry. I parked the rig in low orbit so you could see it, but most of the time you’ll be staying in high orbit. Big transport isn’t really allowed this close to the planet, but without any cargo you could technically even land it. Though I don’t recommend that you do. Hard as fuck to get back up. Believe me.”</p>
<p>They finally arrived at what he had to imagine was the rig Maddy was talking about. Sandeep had researched the topic extensively in the last couple of months, to know what were the best interstellar rigs. But, he quickly realized, along with the bank, that the “best” was not something he could afford, not at this stage. So instead he put his name on a smaller loan and got to looking at older models. Second-hand models. Which was exactly what Maddy was offering, and Sandeep considered himself lucky to have found one on his own home planet.</p>
<p>The rig was very cheap, one of the only ones that Sandeep could afford, and a part of him had trouble believing it would be real. But there was a reason it was cheap; this model was old. So old, in fact, that it didn’t even appear in the brochures and mags he’d looked at. This model was so old, it was made by a company that had been defunct for over half a century.</p>
<p>“She’s a beauty, this one. I had so much fun with it.” Maddy was talking to herself more than she was talking to Sandeep, as her eyes drifted on the curves of the machine, on the way the engine poked from its circular frame, and on other details that Sandeep couldn’t even see from here. “She’s ten years old, you know, relatively speaking. Though she has over 100 light years of travel time behind her belt. But she runs fine. Completely fine.” Maddy’s voice was so nostalgic, Sandeep was half afraid she would change her mind and decide to keep it.</p>
<p>“I need you to understand. I’m not selling it to you because I hate it. I’m selling it to you because I can’t do this anymore.” Her eyes unfocused, and the excitement and nostalgia that was there only a second ago had now been replaced by a deep sense of melancholy. “It’s a lonely life, that of a jumper. You travel from planet to planet, but you can never really set down roots. Are you sure you’re ready for this kid? You’re pretty young, no?” Sandeep, for once, was resolved.</p>
<p>“I’ve wanted to travel my whole life. I can’t stand being on this half-finished planet anymore. I need to see the world! I’ve never even been to Earth. I mean, I haven’t been this far from the surface, ever.” His words were meant to convince Maddy of his resolve and maybe even invoke a bit of pity for the soil-bound boy, but it seemed to have a different effect. “I can’t wait to never leave this planet anymore,” she added. “It’s better than you’d think.”</p>
<p>Maddy entered the inside of the rig with Sandeep, to visit the living spaces. It was quite spacious—a lot more spacious than Sandeep was expecting. There were a couple of rooms, divided by walls with doors. The rig’s rotational grav system was fully functional, though a little stronger than he was anticipating. “It’s imitating Earth gravity,” said Maddy. “That’s stronger than what you’re used to. You can change the setting though, to make you more comfortable.”</p>
<p>“You can keep it. I want to experience things the right way.” Maddy looked at Sandeep funny, but didn’t argue. “Suit yourself. It’s your rig now.”</p>
<p>The rig was in good shape considering its age. Sandeep had almost expected to find half the systems broken, with rusted bolts and leaking fluids. But everything seemed perfect. The diagnostic scan gave it a 95% efficiency, something that would have been impressive even for a rig half this age.</p>
<p>“I got confirmation of the fund transfer kid. She’s all yours now. I hope you have fun with this thing, but be careful, yea? I think you’ll find your dreams don’t lead where you want them to.”</p>
