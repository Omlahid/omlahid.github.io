<h1>Of Time Spent Between The Stars</h1>
<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<p>Sandeep got back to his ship, dejected, and started to look around for jobs. He didn’t want to leave just yet, but there were very few jobs that would allow him to stay within the Barnard system. Barnid was the only true inhabited planet, with only a handful of stations that already had a lot of automated subluminal transport connections to the main planet. And, since these connections tended to be proprietary to a single corporation or government entity, there were very few contractual assignments available. Sandeep still tried to look for one, and even waited two full days in orbit just in case, but nothing came up. Defeated, he turned his eyes to interstellar contracts, where the real money was.</p>
<p>As usual, almost all the cargo was going to the Solar system, though he did notice that there was now a recently built direct route to Proxima Prime. Sandeep seized the opportunity and took a contract that went there. The pay was decent, and he expected the in-system traffic to be a lot easier than the Solar system.</p>
<p>Sandeep moved to the designated jumping location, and engaged the jump. It would take close to a week to reach his destination.</p>
<p>Now that he knew its trick, Sandeep opened the map, and started playing music. He noticed the map kept glitching when he was in lightspeed mode, stuck in an endless loop trying to identify the closest system but getting no response from its pings. Sandeep had to limit the map to a preview of a specific system so it stopped giving him errors. In this case, he opened the Proxima Prime system’s map, since it was his destination.</p>
<p>Before he even started the music, Sandeep looked around on the map. He knew this information would be a couple of decades old, but it was still interesting to see what he could expect.</p>
<p>There were two populated planets around Proxima Prime, and according to the data, both of them had undergone full terraforming. There also seemed to be a lot of stations in high orbit around both of them, and a very busy skyway connecting them, similar to the one between Earth and Mars. He spent a little bit more time analyzing what he could on the map, such as the best place to park his rig to recharge and buy supplies, and checking if there were areas where he could socialize with other jumpers. He knew these kinds of things, especially with reviews, would be next to impossible to get reliable information on until he actually got to his location.</p>
<p>Before he left his home, Sandeep had taken a piece of it with him: a copy of his father’s music. It was his way of mourning his home and family he had lost through time.</p>
<p>He put the music in the console, and was happy to see it connect, no troubleshooting required. He pressed play, and his father’s music played away through the ship’s sound system.</p>
<p>At first, Sandeep smiled at the comforting sounds, but before the end of the first song, he started crying, grieving his father who was now probably already dead, his aging brother, Anish becoming a family man, and most importantly, his mother, whom he had so badly wished to meet again but who had been taken from him. There was so much he missed and would never be able to experience again. Even his attempt at laying roots back in his home had proved fruitless.</p>
<p>The voyage to Proxima Prime was the loneliest he'd felt in his life, even beating his first trip, and the one where he couldn't play music. There was nothing for Sandeep to do to distract him from this sensation that life itself was slipping away from his fingers. He tried to focus on the fact that he was still young, and that, if anything, it was him that was escaping the throes of time, but that did not help calm the sense of dread that comes with having time pass you by at blinding speed.</p>
<p>He eventually arrived at the station on the edge of Proxima Prime. It was a lot less busy than some of the other stations he'd been to. This was normal, he thought. After all, this is a relatively new route, and the main road to Proxima Prime would be through the solar system or through Proxima Two. The road to the Barnard system was likely more of a shortcut.</p>
<p>Sandeep waited for his comm system to tell him instructions, but after a minute, nothing had come on. He decided to speak first instead, but the response came through a series of tones and beeps, something someone like him was obviously not meant to understand. He tried to call again, but the same response came.</p>
<p>Unsure of what to do, but worried he might be blocking other ships coming in, he started to move to a different lane, not quite parked, but out of the way.</p>
<p>He waited there for about fifteen minutes, before a call came on the communication system.</p>
<p>“Rig B16VD, please move to Port D32-L as per the instructions.” The voice sounded synthetic, and Sandeep felt uneasy, but still complied.</p>
<p>As he parked, he saw on the scanners that small machines—likely drones—hovered around his vehicle, including the cargo this time. He was asked to provide credentials, which he did, and promptly received an authorization. It was a lot faster than what he'd experienced when he last arrived in the Barnard system, but he still felt uneasy at having his rig, cargo, and credentials analyzed every time he moved systems, especially since that hadn’t been required before.</p>
<p>Sandeep made his way towards the drop-off point. The map automatically took in the new information when he arrived, and for once, he didn't feel that he needed to update every system on board to be able to function.</p>
<p>The drop-off felt very similar to what he saw at the entrance of the system, with synthetic voices showing him the way after receiving tones and beeps through the comm. Sandeep was confused at this new method of working, and couldn't wait to meet someone that could explain it to him.</p>
<p>After the drop off, he found the highest rated high orbit building in the area, which happened to be a bar specifically catering to jumpers like him. It was in high orbit around Proxima Prime, the planet, not to be confused with the star of the same name.</p>
<p>He parked his rig and took the cruiser to the entrance of the bar. He was glad to see there were other rigs parked around the building, so he was expecting company—exactly what he wanted.</p>
<p>The atmosphere inside the bar was rather sullen, which surprised Sandeep. He would have expected a much better mood with people beating their loneliness together.</p>
<p>Every eye turned on him as he entered. There seemed to be two main groups: one, sitting at the bar, seemed to be in their twenties, while there was a smaller group huddled around a table that looked closer to their fifties or sixties. All in all, there were nine people, with Sandeep making it an even ten. Sandeep decided to sit at the bar.</p>
<p>“You’re a jumper too, right? Where were you born? And when?” The man in the orange puffer jacket and the long beard asked his question before taking a swig of a clear liquid in his glass, obviously not water from the way he was drinking it.</p>
<p>“Barnid, close to New Bangalore. And, about 40 years ago, I think. It’s been hard to keep track,” replied Sandeep.</p>
<p>The man scoffed, and took another swig. “So you’re pretty new then. When I started jumping, Barnid hadn’t even started terraforming, though I’ve jumped there plenty of times now. I’ve been jumping non-stop for close to 300 years. Originally from Mars.” He laughed at Sandeep, as if what he’d said had been a joke. Sandeep ordered a beer, the cheapest thing on the menu. When he got it, the man clinked his glass with his. “My name’s Andrei. Welcome to the bar at the end of the road.”</p>
<p>“Andrei, don’t scare the kid,” said a young woman sitting next to him. “I’m Ngendo. Started jumping from Sirius about 70 years ago.” She raised a glass of what was probably whisky, and took a sip. Sandeep did the same.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, the bar at the end of the road?” asked Sandeep, confused. That was not its name according to the map.</p>
<p>Another woman, two seats down, raised her voice before Andrei had time to answer. “He means there’s no more future for us jumpers. Not for the fleshy ones, at least. You probably heard it, right? The messages sent to your communication device. Hell, Andrei’s got one of those real-time communicators, didn’t even understand it at first.” She laughed at that.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a real-time communicator too. Is that what all those beeps were about?” replied Sandeep. At that mention, Andrei laughed harder. It was becoming more obvious to Sandeep that this was not his first or even third drink. Andrei took Sandeep into a side hug. “You’re like a brother in time! No one here uses real time communicators anymore. They’re the best! I made so many friends this way.”</p>
<p>Sandeep smiled. “I made a good friend too. Back on the Solar system now. He’s got a family, two daughters.” Andrei laughed again, but it seemed he was just in the mood to laugh at everything.</p>
<p>“So what do we do now, as jumpers I mean?” asked Sandeep. “Are there still jobs out there?”</p>
<p>Ngendo scoffed. “If there were any, we wouldn’t be here. I have never seen so many jumpers together in the same room since my first jump, in a bar around Earth. Even the place I went to all the time on Sirius is completely deserted now. Not even staff. Just robots.” She shook her head. “It’s a damn shame, what’s happening to us.” She took a sip of her drink as if mourning her past.</p>
<p>Sandeep slunk down on the stool, dejected.</p>
<p>“Does that mean we’re free to go wherever we want then?” he asked, though he knew this was a naive question.</p>
<p>“We were always free to go wherever we wanted. We’re just not gonna be paid anymore, is all,” answered Andrei.</p>
<p>“But we could go somewhere. Put down roots. Start anew. Can we not?”</p>
<p>“You’re still too young. Our roots, they’re the rigs. It’s what grounds us. It’s the only thing that is true and constant in our lives. The planets grow, the people get older and die, but we persist. We stay the same. With our rigs.”</p>
<p>Everyone at the bar raised their glass and drank. Sandeep did the same. He, too, would have to persist in an ever changing world. When everything but you changes, you need to find what grounds you, and for Sandeep, this would be this motley crew of time-displaced jumpers.</p>
