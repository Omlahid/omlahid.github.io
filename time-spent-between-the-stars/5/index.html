<h1>Of Time Spent Between The Stars</h1>
<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p>It didn’t take long for Sandeep to find a job that went to the Barnard system, though he couldn’t find one straight for Barnid. That didn’t matter, however, as he would easily be able to go on the planet as soon as he got to the system and delivered his cargo.</p>
<p>Sandeep wanted to spend a year back with his family to connect with them again. He did the math, and realized that he could afford to stay there, so long as his family was willing to welcome him back in the house.</p>
<p>As he made the jump from the solar system to the Barnard system, Sandeep realized he hadn’t even stopped to get more entertainment on board. He had been so focused on getting home that he hadn’t stopped to think about something as trivial, though that would soon become a much less trivial thing.</p>
<p>Sandeep started browsing through the media library he had. He decided to just listen to Maddy’s old songs again—they were truly growing on him. He’d spent so much time listening to them now that, even though he couldn’t understand what the lyrics were, he felt that he was able to grasp their meaning. Sandeep even started to give meaning to the words, every sentence fully developed in his mind.</p>
<p>He went to the console, and started to play the music. However, the music did not start. Sandeep checked again, tweaking the settings as much as he understood them, but nothing was coming out. The media player did say that the song was playing, as per usual, but the sound just wasn’t coming on. Sandeep spent a good hour trying different things, but was only met by the silence of the speakers. Frustrated, he left the console, and sat on the floor, with seemingly nothing better to do.</p>
<p>He quickly realized how much the music had helped mold his loneliness into something manageable. It was as if the music was a companion he was conversing with, and in its absence, he felt a renewed resurgence of solitude.</p>
<p>For the first time since he’d left his home, Sandeep started crying. At first, it was a single tear out of frustration, but soon, more tears followed, and the sobbing began. He missed his family, and was angry at himself for losing them for so long. He was quickly reminded of just how young he still was. While he liked to pretend he was a full grown adult, the fact of the matter remained that he was still only 19, and had only ever lived with his family, save for his short—or long, depending on your perspective—life on the rig.</p>
<p>Sandeep sobbed so hard and for so long, he ended up falling asleep on the floor, exhausted.</p>
<p>When he woke up, he was able to rationalize his emotions, and hit the rest of the journey with a renewed motivation for what was to come.</p>
<p>When he arrived in the Barnard’s system, Sandeep was ready and eager to see his family. He opened the map to know where to drop off his cargo, and was hit with a sudden blast of music. The music that he had started playing a few days ago, but never bothered stopping, forgotten in an endless loop of one-sided conversation.</p>
<p>Sandeep started laughing, realizing he was just one click away from salvation from his crushing loneliness. It was as he cried from the laughter that he heard the comm system over the music, telling him to move to a specific port. “For inspection,” it had said, though Sandeep didn’t know exactly what kind of inspection to expect.</p>
<p>Once he moved to the specified port, he was told on the comm to stay inside. He could see through the sensors that two cruisers were moving around his rig, though not checking his cargo. He was asked to produce the contract for his haul, proof of ownership of the rig, his license to operate, and to fill out a long form asking many questions about his visits to the solar planets, moons, and colonies.</p>
<p>It was only after he'd provided the license that he heard through the comm. “You're a Barnid man? Do you still know people here?”</p>
<p>“Yes. My family. I believe they still live there, on a soil farm near New Bangalore. I was going to go see them once I deliver my cargo.”</p>
<p>There was silence on the other side for a couple of minutes, and even the scanner showed the cruisers had left.</p>
<p>“You're free to go. Welcome home.” Sandeep felt a deep satisfaction at being released, and went on his way. He dropped off his cargo, and then parked in lower orbit, just as Maddy had done. The higher orbit around Barnid was rather empty compared to Earth’s, but it was still busier than he'd remembered. The lower orbit was even more empty in comparision, as if Barnid had concentrated all of its orbital stations around the same height.</p>
<p>He took his cruiser—the same cruiser Maddy had used to make him visit the rig initially—down to the surface, and the re-entry into the atmosphere was just as rough as he'd remembered, though he had anticipated it and was fully and properly strapped.</p>
<p>It took Sandeep a second to understand where he was by looking outside. Since he was going home, he didn’t think he would be needing the map. But, the more he looked, the more unfamiliar everything seemed to be. He could recognize some areas, like downtown New Bangalore and its clear cut streets, but the more he moved away from there, the less he seemed to recognize. The place felt almost alien to him. He ended up deciding to just open the map, enter his address, and make his way there.</p>
<p>He landed and parked a little outside of the main farm, next to one of the soil-generating buildings, though he did notice it, too, had changed a bit. After parking his cruiser, Sandeep gathered his belongings, got out, and started to walk towards the house. He was swiftly met by a man, around his age, who was walking toward him with a menacing air. Sandeep didn’t know this man, but the way he was walking made it obvious he meant to turn him away as soon as possible. He was even carrying a stick in his hand, as if it were a weapon, adding to the threatening effect.</p>
<p>“We’re not interested, thank you. You can go back to your cruiser and leave us. Good bye,” the man shouted, without breaking pace. The effect was so striking Sandeep almost wanted to turn around and leave.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Sandeep finally asked, stopping in his tracks. “I want to speak to Lakshmi.” Sandeep thought speaking to his mother, who was the public face of the farm, would help settle the situation. However, his demand didn’t have the intended effect. Instead, the man became overtly angry. “And what would you want to do with Lakshmi, exactly? Who are you, even, bringing her up like this. You better leave now, or I’ll make you leave!”</p>
<p>The shouting woke something in the house, which was just far enough away that he couldn’t see what was going on through the windows, but he did see an older man—likely in his forties—come out. It took Sandeep a second until he realized who had just walked out.</p>
<p>“Rohan, is that you?” he asked, recognizing his little brother, now all grown up.</p>
<p>Rohan’s eyes went wide. “Sandeep, I can’t believe it.” His voice was more stupefied than it was happy, but his eyes twinkled as if travelling to a different time, to that night when Sandeep had left.</p>
<p>The younger man, who had still failed to introduce himself, was immediately calmed by Rohan’s reaction, but he was still confused. “You’re Sandeep? As in, Uncle Sandeep? Is that right dad?” The young man turned back to Sandeep. “I thought you were dead. Gone forever. We honour you and grandma both during Pitru Paksha. Dad, you never told me Sandeep was alive.”</p>
<p>Sandeep did not know what he was supposed to take the hardest in this conversation: the fact that Rohan had taken him for dead all this time, or the fact that he just now understood why this young man had been angry at the mention of his grandmother. It seemed like Sandeep’s mother, in his absence, had passed away.</p>
<p>“Is mom really dead, Rohan?” Sandeep felt his stomach drop. “How long ago? What happened?”</p>
<p>“We have much to talk about, Sandeep. Please, come inside. I will prepare a place for you to stay.”</p>
<p>Sandeep followed his brother inside, still confused and angry by the grief of his mother.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Speaking to Rohan felt like being repeatedly hit with both the hammer and the anvil. Every sentence brought with it its share of sadness, grief, and anxiety. Sandeep was starting to feel nauseous.</p>
<p>His mother, it appeared, had died from an advanced case of cancer that was caught too late. She was moved to a hospital in New Bangalore, but died there, only a week after being admitted. She’d suffered greatly, apparently, and in her final days had called for Sandeep, too far gone in her treatments to understand that Sandeep was gone. This had happened over ten years ago, when Sandeep had been bored out of his mind halfway between Sirius and Earth.</p>
<p>Sandeep’s father had fallen into a deep depression after the death of his wife, and the depression eventually developed into dementia. He was now confined to the house, and Rohan, his wife, and children were taking care of him. They usually left him in his own room, as moving too much around the property was causing him too much distress. Rohan had essentially inherited the house in all but name, and he continued to take care of the farm with his son, Anish, who had met Sandeep outside.</p>
<p>His parents had also accrued a certain amount of debt that Rohan and Anish were working towards solving, but that meant that they would sometimes get visits from debt collectors with aggressive strategies, forcing Anish to become confrontational with anyone who landed closeby.</p>
<p>“We’re working hard,” Rohan had said, “but the planet is almost fully terraformed now. Soil just doesn’t have the same value that it used to. We’re shifting the operation to plant farming, but it’s not working as well. People started importing food machines from Earth that can make food at a fraction of the cost of our fresh produce. So our plants end up in organic farmer markets only, which would be fine if it weren’t for the fact that the market is quite small on Barnid, and it makes no sense to export off-system.</p>
<p>Sandeep was saddened by the conversation, and there was a part of him that thought what happened was his fault. He desperately needed to do something for his little brother.</p>
<p>“I can help,” he tried. “On the farm. You know I can. I used to do it all the time with mom and dad. It's just been a few months for me. I remember how.”</p>
<p>“Things have changed, Sandeep. We don't have the same machines and tools. We've changed how we do things. I could ask Anish to show you around, but I can't have him train you for just a week before you're off again. You have to promise me you're going to stay this time.”</p>
<p>Sandeep thought hard. He didn't want to make an empty promise and leave his brother and children to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>“I promise,” Sandeep said, and meant it. “I’ll stay at least a year. I have my own debts that I need to pay, but I can stay a year. I’ll help on the farm, and try to get things running well. Running better, at least.”</p>
