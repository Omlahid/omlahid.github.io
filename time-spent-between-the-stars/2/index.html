<h1>Of Time Spent Between The Stars</h1>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>Sandeep sat at the controls of his new rig, after he’d gone back on the planet to drop Maddy off at the bar.</p>
<p>He’d gone back to his family to say good bye, promising he would be back before they knew it. His father had cried, his mother had kept a stern face, and his twelve year old little brother had scampered away to his room, slamming the door behind him, refusing to come out even as Sandeep told him goodbye through the door.</p>
<p>Getting his first job had been surprisingly easy, and it was exactly where he wanted to go: Earth.</p>
<p>Sandeep started the rig, feeling the roar of the engine through the floor, and moved it to high orbit. Leaving low orbit was already enough to make Sandeep feel like an old explorer visiting far away lands.</p>
<p>Once in high orbit, he found the warehouse station where his haul was, and parked next to it. He’d been following classes on rigging for the past couple of months, and while he’d never practiced with a real rig, he’d done it in virtual reality plenty of time.</p>
<p>“Rig B16VD, you’re ready to go. Over.” Sandeep hadn’t expected his communication device to be on by default—he’d expected an incoming message notification, but he had to remember that an old rig such as this one wouldn’t have this kind of technology. Hesitantly, Sandeep responded. “Hey, huh, what’s my haul?” He stopped for a second, and added “over,” almost forgetting the protocol.</p>
<p>Sandeep waited for a whole minute, but no message came in. Suddenly, he heard the system come alive again. “Rig B16VD, you’re ready to go. Over.” Sandeep took the hint, and left the warehouse to go to the hyperplane station on the edge of the system.</p>
<p>The gravity on the rig was harder to adapt to than he’d hoped. Every movement felt like a battle against his own ship, his muscles unused to the pressure. But, he powered through. If he wanted to visit other planets, he had to get used to their gravity.</p>
<p>Sandeep activated the lightspeed controls and got ready for interstellar travels. This would be his first jump, officially marking him as a jumper. He would be travelling at near lightspeed, and would spend only a few moments on ship while years pass next to him. But that didn’t matter to him—he was excited for his destination. Earth. The Blue Berth.</p>
<p>Sandeep got the greenlight from the ship—the jump was ready. He aligned his rig at the exact right angle to arrive on the edge of the solar system. He got in his lane, which he knew would be free of ships, and kicked the drive.</p>
<p>His first jump went considerably better than he expected. After the cruiser acceleration of the other day, the lightspeed acceleration with the anti lightspeed gravity shift was a breeze. He did feel an initial push, but he had strapped in so tight that he didn't even move. Once he reached the desired speed, he felt the rig settle. Sandeep waited a few minutes—probably way too long, but he wanted to be safe—and unbuckled.</p>
<p>The rig didn't feel like it was moving at all. He looked through the outside cameras and saw stars in the distance, moving. He knew he was on his way. But he also knew he had a full week of lightspeed to go before he reached Earth.</p>
<p>Sandeep had been so excited by the prospect of travelling to Earth that he almost forgot to bring anything to actually do while on the rig. And this rig was so old—it barely had an entertainment system on board.</p>
<p>Sandeep had still brought something with him: a book, <em>Around The Systems in 80 Days</em>. It was a retelling of Jules Verne’s <em>Around The World In 80 Days</em>, but in the context of the stellar expansion that happened in the solar system, when Earth first settled in and around most planets, dwarf planets, and moons of the solar system. It followed the same main storyline, of getting through each hub and station in under 80 days, with many adventures happening along the way. It was not very realistic, nor was it meant to be. It introduced intelligent alien species on Europa and Ganymede, and portrayed the Mars colonists extremely offensively. It wasn't exactly politically correct, but it was still a classic that influenced the writing of its time, and Sandeep wanted to finally be able to get through the whole thing cover to cover.</p>
<p>It only took him an hour before he got bored of it, and was searching for something else to do. The book just didn't live up to his expectations, and every sentence was a slog to get through.</p>
<p>Sandeep started exploring the rest of the habitable area of the rig. There was a bed in a small sectioned area, a bathroom with a zero gravity adapted toilet but no bath or shower—he had to clean himself with a washcloth—and a pantry with food he didn't need to cook. He probably had a good two months worth of food, as well as emergency rations for another 4 months that he was hoping he wouldn't have to resort to. But, the trip to Earth was quite short, so he should be able to refill his stash then.</p>
<p>Sandeep checked the onboard computer and started fiddling with it, checking what Maddy had left or forgotten to remove. It didn't take too long before he found her music catalog, which contained only a couple of albums from over a century ago. All Earth music, he noticed, save for one Martian artist. He pressed play on an album he thought looked promising, and a gritty voice started playing through the rig’s sound system. Sandeep didn't recognize the language it was being sung in, but the emotions were clear. This was a sad ballad about grief and loss.</p>
<p>As the song played, Sandeep continued to look through the computer system, and found a simple text file, as obvious as it could be. The file read “DO NOT UPDATE” in all caps. Nothing else. Sandeep was intrigued, but didn't know what to make of it. It didn’t seem to be attached to any particular program.</p>
<p>Sandeep spent the rest of the week playing the music Maddie had left on board, and continually trying and failing to get into his book. He made a mental note to get more entertainment for the next trip. He didn't expect the most exciting part of his life to involve so much waiting time.</p>
<p>The music, he quickly realized, was all of the same genre of gritty voices singing in what was probably the same language, with a very similar sound. Some songs had really good rifts, while some others left more to be desired. They tended to be the ones where the vocals were put forward, with the other instruments taking a back step.</p>
<p>He was midway through one of the songs he was growing to like when the console on the ship started beeping, announcing his arrival at the edge of the solar system.</p>
<p>All the boredom of the last week vanished in a second when his rig slowed to subluminal speeds. As soon as he arrived at the edge of the system, the console came aglow with lights and sounds buzzing off everywhere. It seemed every single light and signal that could turn on in his rig turned on. The sound system started blasting alerts and pings he couldn’t recognize or understand. It took Sandeep a minute to understand where he even needed to focus his attention.</p>
<p>He thought to look at the main screen of the console first. And suddenly, the message from earlier started to make sense.</p>
<p>Every alert was asking him to upgrade every system on his ship. The main console, the navigational system, the rotational gravity system, the temperature controls, the sound system, and a lot more systems with names so obscure he had no idea what they were even referring to. And, it seemed, every update only had one option: to accept.</p>
<p>Sandeep had never been comfortable around computers. He knew his way around machines, especially the ones on the farm at home, sure. He also knew his way around how rigs work, though this was a lot more theory than praxis. But the software itself was something he didn't know anything about. The computers on Barnid were very much on the practical side, and his family's only computer controlled the machinery of the farm. Sandeep had never been allowed to play with it due to its importance.</p>
<p>Sandeep remembered Maddy’s warning, and trusted she had left it for a reason. He figured out a way to ignore the update alerts by turning off the sound system, but he could still see a small light flash from time to time indicating updates were pending.</p>
<p>Once he managed to shut off all the noise, he heard the communication system come in with a message.</p>
<p>“B16VD please state your destination. Over.” Then, a few seconds later, before Sandeep had time to answer, another message came in, this time with a much more excited voice. “B16VD, are you using a real time communicator? Over.” Sandeep quickly took the receiver, and answered. “Hyperplane station B, this is B16VD. Yes, I am using a real time communicator. This is actually my first time in the solar system.” Sandeep was so excited, it took him a second before adding the required “Over.”</p>
<p>The answer came without any pause. “Wow, I almost never get real time communicators. This is so cool! How long have you been jumping with this ship? Crazy that you've never been to the solar system before. Over.”</p>
<p>“This is in fact my first jump. I just got this rig. Over.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it, such a vintage ship! Oh, and what was your destination? Over.”</p>
<p>Sandeep got shaken back to reality. “Huh, sorry. Earth. Over.”</p>
<p>“Sweet, you can go to port B-52-AF. Hey, before you leave. Would you mind waiting about an hour or so there? I need a lift, and your ship sounds extremely cool. Over.”</p>
<p>The week-long ride in complete loneliness made Sandeep immediately accept.</p>
<p>Sandeep parked in the designated area, and started waiting. He’d occasionally get communication messages from the operator on the other side, who obviously just wanted to chat about the ship.</p>
<p>A bit over an hour later, Sandeep’s scans indicated a cruiser had docked on the rig. Sandeep immediately initiated the airlock process. He was very giddy when he went to the pressurization room between the airlocks to meet the man on the other side of the communicator.</p>
<p>The window gave him a view of a small, mustachioed man with a large smile on his face. He looked very young, possibly as young as Sandeep himself.</p>
<p>They watched each other through the window, both smiling, until the pressure stabilized, and the door could open.</p>
<p>The man on the other side opened the door, and Sandeep quickly came to help him.</p>
<p>“Thank you for giving me a ride,” he said, all smiles. Sandeep couldn’t help but smile back at him.</p>
<p>“Of course! I was heading that way anyway.” Sandeep took another second of silence. His week alone seemed to have made any social skills he had disappear in a second. “Sorry, what was your name again?”</p>
<p>The person onboard his ship was too busy admiring the insides of his rig to answer. After a few seconds, once his brain had processed the question, he turned to face Sandeep. “Of course! Hi, I’m Luiz. Nice to meet you.” He extended a hand, and Sandeep shook it, introducing himself.</p>
<p>“You’ve got a great rig here, wow!” Luiz exclaimed. “This is so vintage, but so well preserved. There’s no way this is your first jump. It can’t have lived for over a century like that.”</p>
<p>“The ship has jumped its fair share of times. Apparently it’s been running for about ten years, or so I heard.” Luiz’s face went agasp. “No way, ten years? Even for ten years this is such a well preserved piece of history. You know, back in the early jumping days, jumpers had ships just like this one.” Luiz’s mind was obviously somewhere else as he blattered on the technology jumpers used to have, navigating some nostalgia Sandeep had trouble connecting to, but which he was sure Maddy would have understood.</p>
<p>Luiz suddenly stopped and looked back at Sandeep. “Sorry, was I infodumping again? I’ve been told I do that often. It’s just, ships like these.” He motioned to the whole rig. “They’re just so exciting. They come from a time when we were still figuring things out. From a time when not everything was set in a very specific, controlled way, when people were able to connect to one another. Back in the days, jumpers were seen as the connectors between the different worlds, not as a tool for capitalistic endeavors, to be tossed aside once used. I’m just so happy to have found someone that thinks like me.” Sandeep didn’t want to correct Luiz, that he in fact did not choose the ship because he wanted something nostalgic, but because it was the only thing he could afford. The smile on Luiz’s face was something he didn’t want to lose, and he took a mental picture of his excitement, to revisit when he felt particularly lonely on this ship like he had been for the last week.</p>
<p>“So, hum, you said you needed to go to Earth, right?” Sandeep interrupted, trying to get back on topic.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. You can leave me in high orbit—I’ll take my cruiser down from there. I know you can’t drive this rig in lower orbit even after dropoff, so no worries. I still appreciate the trip to the planet.” Luiz sounded so friendly, in a way Sandeep wasn’t sure he’d be expecting from someone from Earth, but maybe the fact that they were both the same age and both living in similar working fields made it more comfortable.</p>
<p>Sandeep went back to the control station, and started typing coordinates. The lights from the updates were still blinking.</p>
<p>“Want me to take care of that?” Luiz asked. “I hate those updates too. I can disable them if you want.” Sandeep had some reservations about giving up control of his computer to someone else, but he had to admit that there was no way he would ever figure out how to make his computer normal again.</p>
<p>“Please, if you can.” Sandeep felt a little ashamed at having someone else solve his problem, but that shame gave way to amazement when he saw Luiz take over the computer and start doing things he didn’t even know were possible. He started opening windows he didn’t think existed, turned some settings on, and clicked on parts of the screen that, even when squinting, he couldn’t differentiate from the rest.</p>
<p>“That’s gonna do it,” he finally told Sandeep, after a couple of minutes of fiddling around on the computer system. “You shouldn’t be prompted to update the systems anymore, until they figure a way out of this. But for now you’re good.” Sandeep thanked Luiz, and they started on their way to Earth’s high orbit, near the warehouse where he was supposed to drop off his load.</p>
<p>The subluminal path from the edge of the system to Earth took a bit longer than Sandeep had expected. He thought that now that he’d reached the solar system, navigating it could take a few minutes between planets. But it took almost the full day. The solar system was so much larger than Barnard’s system! And, he had to pay more attention to the path—especially as they were nearing Earth—as it was not nearly as empty as his home system. But, with good company, the day went by very quickly.</p>
<p>Sandeep learned that Luiz had been born on Earth, in the large sprawling metropolis of Mexico City. Sandeep had heard the name before, but he wasn’t the most familiar with it. That didn’t matter, because Luiz was too happy to tell him all about the culture there: the food, the sports, and—as was now a recurring theme—the way things used to be so much better before. “I couldn’t even stay, that’s how bad the economy’s gotten. I had to find a job off planet, and on the edge of the system at that! You know, not that I don’t like you, but it can get quite boring there. This was actually my first shift too. I’ve been stationed there for almost 3 months, can you imagine! Day in and day out in that station, always eating the same food. You’ve only been here a week, so you can imagine what a full three months would be like.” He always told stories in the most dramatic ways, as if everything was a life or death scenario, but Sandeep liked that. He’d been told people on Earth tended to be extremely passionate and hot blooded, and so far, that seemed to be right.</p>
<p>The planets of the system zoomed past them faster than he had time to appreciate. If Luiz hadn’t pointed it out, he might have even missed Mars, the Emerald Gem, with its subterranean ocean that gave its citizens the water it needed. The tale of the first terraforming was something he’d been taught over and over and over at school, probably because his own planet was in the process of being terraformed.</p>
<p>“It’s crazy what they were able to do to Mars,” Sandeep finally allowed himself to say. Luiz raised an eyebrow. “I mean the terraforming. We’re taught about it in school so much. It’s crazy to think how far we’ve come.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know too much about that. Look at what they’ve become. Their government is in shambles after scandals and scandals. It’s like, they came to power just to give contracts to their friends’ companies. Meanwhile the people aren’t getting the services they need, or they need to pay a premium for it. I tell you, give it a couple of years, and Mars will come begging for Earth to take on their debt. Or maybe the people will finally do something.” Luiz was half-smirking, but Sandeep didn’t know how to answer. “Sorry,” Luiz responded. “I guess you’re probably not familiar with Mars politics. After all, you just arrived in the solar system, so at best your info is a decade and a half old.” He laughed at that statement, as if he’d just told a joke that only he understood. Sandeep smiled back, naively, a growing anxiety taking place inside of him.</p>
<p>Earth’s high orbit was crowded with rows after rows of warehouses and stations and other buildings he couldn’t identify. “You can leave me at that shuttle station right there,” Luiz motioned on the computer’s map, setting the rig on a route for it. “From there, I can take a cruiser route straight to Mexico city, and visit my family. They know I’ll be coming, and I’ll be good for two weeks before I have to head back.”</p>
<p>Sandeep waved Luiz goodbye through the airlock as he left, and shuddered at the loneliness of his cockpit again. He moved towards the warehouse he needed to drop his cargo at, and after what felt like an eternity stuck in heavy traffic, finally arrived. It had now been over twenty four hours since Sandeep had last slept, and his eyes were starting to burn.</p>
<p>The communicator came ablaze with a message. “Rig B16VD please drop the cargo in the designated area. Over.” Sandeep checked his screen, and saw that he’d received a request from the warehouse. Accepting it gave him coordinates, and Sandeep went that way.
He dropped his cargo off, and parked the rig on the side to recharge, where other jumpers like him were doing what he was now desperately trying to do. Catch some sleep. And he did catch it quickly that night, with the memory of Luiz lulling him to sleep.</p>
