<h1>Of Time Spent Between The Stars</h1>
<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<p>The rig was empty and solitary, as usual, but Sandeep was enjoying it this time. He was still high on the emotions from the fight, even though it had already been a couple of hours. Sandeep was still too angry to calm down and go to sleep.</p>
<p>Sandeep had sneaked in a bottle of whisky from his brother’s house. He had no idea if this was an important bottle, but at this point, he didn’t care. He hadn’t even had a single drop of alcohol since his beer back on the ghost station of Sirius, and he felt like he truly needed a drink. He grabbed a glass, and started pouring himself one. He drank all night, emptying half the bottle, still fuming, before collapsing on his bed and waking up with a strong headache the next day.</p>
<p>He quickly realized the mistake he'd made, and he started to get ready to apologize, but his usual slow routine and headache didn't make him want to hurry. He was so used to spending his long days on board that he'd almost forgotten how to do things quickly. He still took time to wash himself, and with his hangover, went over to the gravity system and turned it down, to the standards of Barnid. There's no point in keeping it at Earth's levels if he wasn't even going to visit Earth.</p>
<p>In the late morning, Sandeep finally found the courage and energy to go back home, and took his cruiser there. The re-entry into the atmosphere while hungover was particularly painful, and while he didn't hurl, it came extremely close.</p>
<p>When he landed the cruiser, he took a minute to gather his thoughts and settle his stomach. It was at that moment that he realized he had forgotten the rest of the bottle of whisky up on the ship. Sandeep hoped Rohan wouldn't notice, though he would probably be able to guess Sandeep had been drinking.</p>
<p>The minute he came out of his cruiser, he heard shouting. It was Anish, with his father in tow, obviously trying to calm the situation, but still equally as angry.</p>
<p>“Let me speak Anish,” Rohan finally shouted, over whichever expletives Anish had been hurling at Sandeep.</p>
<p>Rohan approached Sandeep, clear anger in his eyes but somehow with a calm composure. “You promised,” he finally started. “You promised you would help with the farm and with the debts. But you've been slacking at work, never awake on time. Anish has to wake you up every single day. And the one day you're by yourself, you come when it's almost noon, stinking of alcohol.” Rohan made a disgusted face. “We gave you a roof and food, and you thank us by insulting me. I don't care that you're my older brother. I am still your senior and the person in charge of this house.” He paused and looked daggers at Sandeep.</p>
<p>“Now there are two paths forward. Will you apologize to me and my son?”</p>
<p>Sandeep felt his anger from the previous night surging back through him, and didn't want to answer. “Let me speak to dad. You can't stop me from speaking to dad.” Anish didn’t look like he wanted to agree, but he stepped aside.</p>
<p>“Fine. Go talk to him. But you better come back after if you intend on keeping a good relationship with your family.” When Sandeep started walking away and Anish thought he was out of earshot, he heard him say, “or he could just leave us. He was a better uncle when he was dead.”</p>
<p>Sandeep pretended not to hear, and entered the house. He walked to his dad's door, knocked, and entered.</p>
<p>His dad was sitting up in his bed, listening to music that he used to listen to all the time when Sandeep was younger. He had always hated that kind of music as a kid and teenager, but today, it made him smile.</p>
<p>“Hey Dad. It's me. It's Sandeep.” His dad opened his eyes at the voice, but there was no recognition in them. “Sandeep?” He answered. “Sandeep,” he repeated, though with more conviction this time.</p>
<p>“I thought you were dead. I thought we'd lost you oh, so long ago now. I cried for your death. I grieved and mourned you. Sandeep, have you come to haunt me?”</p>
<p>Sandeep’s smile faded. “No dad, I’m here. I’ve travelled. I’ve been to Earth, and to Sirius. I’ve made a friend, who now has daughters of his own. Dad, I’ve come back.”</p>
<p>His father’s eyes watered, and it looked like some light left his eyes as he looked at Sandeep. “Oh, if only Lakshmi could come to see me as well. I would love to see her again.” He looked away, and then back at Sandeep. “Do you know where she is? I’ve been looking for my wife.”</p>
<p>Sandeep felt tears fall down his face, and hugged his father, who didn’t know how to react at first, but eventually hugged him back.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, dad. I’m sorry for everything that’s happening to you. Rohan will be taking good care of you. I love you.”</p>
<p>With that, Sandeep left, knowing this would be the last conversation he would have with his father.</p>
<p>As he exited the door, he saw Rohan waiting there. “I understand you’ll be breaking your promise then, Sandeep.” He crossed his arms, and looked down at the floor. “I can’t say I’m too surprised. You were never one to want to set down roots, always with your head in the clouds. Well, you can go meet those clouds again, brother. You can go see what the world has to offer as you travel, forever young in a world that lives without you.” Rohan moved to the kitchen table and sat down on a chair, before putting his head in his hands.</p>
<p>“I know you’ll want to come back eventually. With luck, I’ll still be alive. But I don’t know that Anish will feel good about welcoming you. I want you to understand, brother, and I say this with love. If you come back, don’t expect us to take you in like we just did. You will have to find your own place to stay, and your own food. You can come visit, but I can’t guarantee you’ll be able to stay long.”</p>
<p>Sandeep felt betrayed. This was the first time he didn’t feel welcome in his own home—or, he should stop thinking about it this way. This wasn’t his home anymore. A home is something you build together, and if you leave it too long, you stop building, and other people take your place and build it themselves, until it eventually becomes someone else’s home. Sandeep hadn’t thought of it this way, but with mother gone and father soon to follow, it would truly become Rohan’s home, where he lives with his wife and children. A home that, while it honoured the name of Sandeep, didn’t welcome him as a living being. Only as a memory.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to have disturbed your life,” Sandeep responded. Rohan started laughing, though his eyes wanted to cry. “Oh Sandeep, but I was very happy to see you again. It’s a shame that you have to go, but I knew it would happen. When I made you promise to stay a year, I knew you wouldn’t be able to stay that long. But I also knew you’d make an extra effort to stay as long as you could. I know Anish has been hard on you, but his life has been trifled with debt and bad news. Yours had only been about the good things happening in this family, back when soil was the single most in-demand thing on this planet, and we were able to produce a lot of it.” Rohan took a second to recollect his thoughts. “The world is changing, Sandeep. Or rather, it has changed, fully terraformed. And we’re trying to adapt to it, and we will, with enough time. But you, I don’t know if you’ll be able to. It moves quickly, but you move even quicker.”</p>
<p>Rohan took a deep sigh, got up, and hugged Sandeep. “I will miss you, brother. I always have. That’s why I taught my son to honour you during Pitru Pashka. That’s why I got angry when you left. But I’m not twelve anymore, yet you’re still nineteen. You’re the same age as my son, do you realize that?” Sandeep hugged his brother back, and he felt new tears run down his cheek. “I’m sorry you can’t stay, Sandeep. But I understand. I hope the sky gives you what you need.”</p>
<p>As he exited the house, Sandeep saw Anish, who was still brooding. Upon seeing his father, his expression quickly changed. “Wait dad, he’s leaving?” Anish had an anguished look on his face.</p>
<p>“Yes, son. Sandeep is returning where he came from,” replied Rohan.</p>
<p>Anish took a second, and eventually put his hand towards Sandeep for a handshake.</p>
<p>“Sorry I was rough on you Uncle,” he added, though it wasn’t clear in his voice if he was being serious. “I still liked being able to meet you. I hope you have fun out there. Maybe when you come back I’ll have my own wife and children. Maybe you will too.”</p>
<p>Sandeep shook the hand back, thanking Anish for his patience.</p>
<p>When Sandeep got back on his cruiser to get to his rig, the only thing preventing the tears from falling was the g-force of exiting the atmosphere.</p>
