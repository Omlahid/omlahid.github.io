<h1>Of Time Spent Between The Stars</h1>
<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<p>The next morning, Anish came to Sandeep’s room before sunrise to wake him up. Sandeep was still living in a weird jet lag of his own.</p>
<p>“Uncle Sandeep, you have to get up. We need to start before sunrise if we want to get the most out of the day.” Sandeep begrudgingly got up, dressed, and followed Anish.</p>
<p>The building Sandeep had parked next to had been converted to a greenhouse, where a large variety of plants—mostly nutritional—were growing. Sandeep recognized carrots, cabbages, and cauliflowers, but there were other plants in different stages of growth that he could not identify.</p>
<p>Anish and Sandeep worked all day in the greenhouse, rotating the stacks, harvesting and planting new seeds, washing the produce and readying them for consumption, re-soiling the tills, and making sure the lamps were functioning and calibrated. It took them most of the day, only taking a small break to eat something before continuing to work. They didn’t even stop to drink water, instead opting to drink straight out of the moisturizer they were using, which meant Sandeep had drunk at least a bit of mud. “I’ve been doing it since I was a kid,” Anish had said. “Don’t worry too much. It helps build the immune system.” He laughed, not sure if he was believing it or repeating something he’d heard in the past.</p>
<p>That night, Sandeep collapsed on his bed, despite the jet lag, and slept like a baby.</p>
<p>The next few weeks went by in a similar fashion. He would get woken up by Anish—Sandeep had still not figured out how Anish managed to be up and awake so early while Sandeep still struggled getting up even after sunrise—go to the greenhouse, and take care of the plants and produce. There were other days when they would go to New Bangalore to sell some of their produce at the farmer’s market, which was much larger than Sandeep was anticipating. They would often also buy some new seeds when in town. Sandeep quickly realized that these seeds were quite expensive, but Anish had told him the fertilizer—which they were grateful to be able to produce in-house—was even more expensive.</p>
<p>“We sell the produce because the margin’s higher,” Anish had said, “but the fertilizer market is still a good investment. It costs less to produce, and our margin is lower, but it’s a steady stream of income that requires a lot less work.” Sandeep was surprised at how business savvy Anish was, especially considering they were essentially the same age.</p>
<p>Anish was always respectful to Sandeep, but there was a wall between them that Sandeep just couldn’t get through. It made the working day a lot heavier than he would have liked, as any attempt at conversation ended with a quick—though polite—dismissal from Anish, who would be commenting on the way Sandeep was working, or offering suggestions.</p>
<p>That was getting on Sandeep’s nerves—the attitude Anish was taking towards him. Anish was always acting like he was Sandeep’s boss, and almost denigrated his work. Sure, he would call him “uncle,” but that almost felt like a formality, not the type of respect Sandeep would be expecting from his nephew.</p>
<p>Sandeep was thankful he could see his father, though speaking to him was particularly painful. The first time they had spoken to each other, his father hadn’t even recognized him. Rohan tried to reassure him that it was normal, that he didn’t recognize Anish either despite living in the same house all their lives. But that only helped Sandeep feel even more alienated in his own home.</p>
<p>And of course, there was the issue of his little brother, though he was little no more. There was always an insurmountable gap between the both of them, and every step that Sandeep was making towards him was met with a step back from Rohan. Sandeep wasn’t sure what was causing this distance between the both of them, but he thought that the physical distance he’d put between him and his family was the source of his issues.</p>
<p>One night, after a particularly gruelling day at work, Sandeep exploded at Rohan.</p>
<p>“Why are you treating me like this, little brother? When I left, things were going well on the farm, and mom and dad agreed that it was okay for me to leave. Do you not remember how you were the one who cowered in your room? You didn’t even come to say good bye, even as I spoke to you through your door. And now that I’ve come back, you treat me like a stranger, or worse, like a servant. They are my family too, Rohan, not just yours.” The anger spoke more than he did, and there were certain things that Sandeep said that he immediately regretted, but his pride and the overflowing emotions of the last weeks stopped him from apologizing.</p>
<p>Rohan was in no mood to let Sandeep walk over him, and the argument escalated. By the end, Sandeep had gone back on his rig, only a month and half into the year he’d promised.</p>
