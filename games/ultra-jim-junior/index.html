<p>Note: This game only works on Windows.</p>
<p>I made this game in August 2019 for the 2019 Community Jam. It had been 2 years since I'd last made a game, and we had a full week to work on this.</p>
<p>I had taken my week off (for other reasons but still) and was working with someone who was not fully dedicated to the jam, so I spent a lot of time of this jam throwing ideas to myself and trying to see what I can figure out without coding.</p>
<p>This project was made with Unity, which was very new to me. So my partner for this game handled all of the Unity stuff, and I made the assets and the story. I don't think I'd even installed Unity for this, and if I did, I didn't play with the game really except for testing purposes.</p>
