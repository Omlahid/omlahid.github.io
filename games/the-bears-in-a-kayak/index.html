<p><a href="https://omlahid.itch.io/the-bears-in-a-kayak">You can play the game in browser here.</a></p>
<p>I made this game in July 2020 for the GMTK Game Jam 2020, where the theme was Out Of Control.</p>
<p>The point of the game was that the bear was loose in a kayak, and you control the river current left or right to try and make it avoid the rocks while catching the fish.</p>
<p>This was supposed to be a duo project with a developer who had experience in game development, but unfortunately that game jam weekend, he suddenly became unavailable, and while he did help me think through a couple of things in the beginning, this was essentially a solo project, since I created all the assets (except the music) and all the code for the game.</p>
<p>This was also my first foray into Unity, the first real game engine I was using. In 2020, Unity was still THE go-to engine for anyone doing video game development as a hobby, and there was (and still is) a TON of tutorials online helping you play with it.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun doing this game, learning both Unity and Blender. I'm not particularly proud of the end product, but it was an extremely good learning experience.</p>
