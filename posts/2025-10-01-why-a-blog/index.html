   <p>Hey everyone! This is my first blog post on this new site I'm just creating.</p>
<p>I've been meaning to create a blog back again for a while now, just trying to get my thoughts out in the world. I have a lot of conflicting thoughts about creating such a thing, and maybe I'll try to highlight them here.</p>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<p>Oh man, am I a nostalgic person. There is just something about the old way the internet used to be that vibes with me.</p>
<p>Recently (in like 2022 shut up) I played a great game, called <a href="https://hypnospace.fandom.com/wiki/Hypnospace_Outlaw_Wiki"><strong>Hypnospace Outlaw</strong></a>. I'll talk about this game probably in a different post. Hypnospace Outlaw plays on that nostalgia a lot, for a time that I technically didn't really get to experience, with GeoCities-style personal pages.</p>
<p>And this appealed to me. The way websites are just made by random people, who just put their own technical skills and personal experience and interests out in the open for other people to enjoy, with no real gain other than sharing. This is something that appeals to me a lot. Sharing.</p>
<p>And as the internet has become more widespread, it started centering around specific platforms to allow people to share amongst them - MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, Reddit, nowadays Discord too. I do want to say, I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I think it allows more and more people to share stuff with each other (which I guess can be both a good and a bad thing). But, there is something lost in gravitating to these spaces. They're all designed in mostly similar ways, with a User Experience that tries to imitate what other people are doing so as to remove friction, but in doing so removes a lot of personality.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong though. I strongly believe we have more unique, hyper-personalized, random blogs from random people online right now than we've ever had in the history of the internet. But, it's now a much, much smaller percentage of the internet, which is now an ultra massive, multi-billion dollar industry (which I'm part of so huh... can't truly complain there I guess?), which overshadows these smaller sites.</p>
<p>So in doing this blog, I'm trying to add a little to the uniqueness that made the internet.</p>
<p>Also, to be frank, I want a space where I can just put my ideas and throw them to the world, and just see what happens.</p>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<p>Okay so this one is gonna be a funny one but I'll skip the controversial part. I guess maybe I'll do another post about it at another point.</p>
<p>So, Generative AI, right? That's a thing now. Whether you like it or not, I don't think the GPT-powered LLM platforms are going away any time soon. And, to get good, they need to scrape the internet (and a lot more) to get to content and ingest it.</p>
<p>So there are two reasons why I don't like creating a blog in this post-commodification of generative models world.</p>
<p>The first one is that I'm not in love with the idea of my words being consumed by megacorporations to their own gains. There was a time when I could agree that like, Microsoft and Google could scrape my content to be linked on their pages, but at the end of the day, that content was still mine, and people would be coming to my site, not theirs. However, my content being scraped directly never to have people return kinda hurts. Of course I'm not just talking about me, but about every small site out there.</p>
<p>And don't get me wrong - I've written plenty of stuff on the internet in the past, a lot of which has been scraped and is being used by these large GPT-powered entities. But a lot of that stuff was like, corporate stuff I was paid actual money to write, so it doesn't feel as bad to me to have it be taken.</p>
<p>The second thing I don't like is that the popularization of all the Generative AI platforms makes it extremely quick to create a blog, but it doesn't necessarily translate into a quality of ideas, especially since some people are purely automating the creation of sites for the sake of ads and clicks and cross-linking for SEO purposes. It's a weird world I guess. Whenever I read something, I can never know if it was written by an actual person, or an engine that statistically put words together to try and convey some meaning that is lost to itself anyway. And I don't know how I feel about that.</p>
<p>However, I'm confident that enough people feel the same, and refuse to use these platforms to create their blogs, trying to keep it more &quot;real&quot; and personal.</p>
<h2>So, what now?</h2>
<p>I guess what you can expect in the future is a couple more articles written from me. This one was a bit more vague with no real topic discussed, but I intend to write about stuff I've been experiencing in my life, like new games I'm playing, books I'm reading, music I'm listening to. I would add movies and TV shows too, but being honest I almost never watch anything these days.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for stopping by and taking the time to read this. It means a lot to me. I'll be seeing you in the next one, hopefully.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
